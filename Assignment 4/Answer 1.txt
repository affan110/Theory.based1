Explain Hoisting in JavaScript

oisting is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows variables and function declarations to be moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that you can use variables and call functions before they are actually declared in your code.

Here are a few key points to understand about hoisting:

Variable Hoisting: When a variable is hoisted, the declaration (not the assignment) is moved to the top of its scope. This means you can access the variable before it is declared in the code. However, the variable will still be assigned the default value of undefined until the assignment statement is reached.

Function Hoisting: Function declarations are also hoisted to the top of their scope. This means you can call a function before it is defined in the code. Regardless of where you call the function, it will be available due to hoisting.
Hoisting Scope: Hoisting occurs at the scope level. Variables and functions are hoisted within their respective scopes. Global variables and functions are hoisted to the top of the global scope, while variables and functions declared within a function are hoisted to the top of that function's scope.

Variable Assignments: Only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations or assignments. Therefore, if you access a variable before it is assigned a value, it will return undefined.

Hoisting Caveats: It's important to be aware of hoisting's potential pitfalls. Hoisting can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if you rely on variables or functions being available before their actual declarations. It is considered good practice to declare variables and functions before using them to avoid confusion and improve code readability.
