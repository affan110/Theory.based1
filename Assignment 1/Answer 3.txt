Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?

HTML Tags:

HTML tags are the building blocks of HTML markup.
They are used to define the structure and formatting of the content within an HTML document.
Tags are written within angle brackets (< >) and are usually represented by a pair of opening and closing tags.
Opening tags indicate the start of an element and are denoted by the tag name.
Closing tags indicate the end of an element and are denoted by the tag name preceded by a forward slash (/).
Example:
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

HTML Elements:

HTML elements are composed of opening and closing tags along with the content they enclose.
They represent the actual components and entities in an HTML document.
Elements consist of the opening tag, content, and closing tag, forming a complete unit.
Elements can be nested, meaning one element can contain another element(s) as its content.
Example:
<div>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a div element.</p>
</div>
