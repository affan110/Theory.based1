Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some global attributes?


HTML Tags:

HTML tags are used to define the structure and formatting of elements within an HTML document.
Tags are written within angle brackets (< >) and consist of opening and closing tags, with content placed between them.
Tags define the type and purpose of an element, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, etc.
Each HTML tag serves a specific function and has its own set of rules and attributes associated with it.
Example:
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

HTML Attributes:

HTML attributes provide additional information or properties for HTML elements.
Attributes are used within HTML tags and provide specific instructions or settings for elements.
Attributes modify the behavior or appearance of an element, define relationships, or provide additional metadata.
Attributes are defined using the attribute name followed by an equals sign (=) and enclosed in quotes (single or double).
Elements can have multiple attributes, each separated by a space.
Example:
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example Website</a>

Global Attributes:
Global attributes are attributes that can be applied to any HTML element, regardless of its specific tag. Here are some examples of global attributes:

class: Specifies one or more class names for an element, allowing CSS styling and JavaScript manipulation.
id: Defines a unique identifier for an element, often used for targeting the element with CSS or JavaScript.
style: Specifies inline CSS styles for an element, allowing the application of custom styling.
title: Provides additional information or a tooltip for an element when the user hovers over it.
data-*: Allows the addition of custom data attributes to elements for storing custom data.
Example:
<div class="container" id="myContainer" style="background-color: blue;" title="This is a container">
  <p data-custom="123">Some text inside the container.</p>
</div>
