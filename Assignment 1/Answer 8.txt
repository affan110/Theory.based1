What is the difference between <figure> tag and <img> tag?

<img> tag:

The <img> tag is a self-closing tag used to insert an image into an HTML document.
It does not require a closing tag because it doesn't contain any content.
The primary purpose of the <img> tag is to display an image on a web page.
It requires the src attribute, which specifies the URL or path to the image file.
Additional attributes such as alt, width, height, and title can be used to provide alternative text, set dimensions, and provide tooltips for the image.
The <img> tag is standalone and does not have any inherent semantic meaning.
Example:

<img src="path_to_image.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="300" height="200">


<figure> tag:
The <figure> tag is a container element used to group related content, typically an image and its caption or description.
It provides a semantic structure to associate an image with its explanatory content.
The <figure> tag requires a corresponding closing </figure> tag.
It is commonly used in conjunction with the <figcaption> tag to add a caption or description for the image.
The <figure> tag is useful when you want to visually associate an image with its textual description, making it easier for screen readers and search engines to understand the relationship.
Example:
<figure>
  <img src="path_to_image.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="300" height="200">
  <figcaption>Caption or description of the image</figcaption>
</figure>
