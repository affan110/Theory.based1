Q.1 Whatâ€™s Constructor And Its Purpose?

A constructor is a special method in a class that initializes objects of that class. Its purpose is to set up the initial state of the object by assigning values to its properties or variables. Constructors ensure that objects start in a valid and consistent state before they are used.
