Q.3 Explain SetTimeOut and setInterval ?

setTimeout and setInterval are JavaScript functions that allow you to schedule the execution of code at a later time. They are commonly used for creating timed events, animations, and periodically updating content on web pages.

The setTimeout function is used to execute a piece of code or a function after a specified delay in milliseconds. It takes two parameters: a function or a piece of code to be executed, and the delay in milliseconds before the execution. Once the delay has passed, the code is executed once. It is a one-time event.

For example, the following code will display a message after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds):

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Delayed message");
}, 2000);


The setInterval function, on the other hand, is used to repeatedly execute a function or a piece of code at a specified interval. It also takes two parameters: a function or code to be executed, and the interval in milliseconds between each execution. The code will be executed repeatedly until clearInterval is called or the web page is closed.

Here's an example of setInterval that displays a message every 1000 milliseconds (1 second):

var counter = 0;

var intervalId = setInterval(function() {
  console.log("Message " + counter);
  counter++;
}, 1000);


In this example, the code will display "Message 0", "Message 1", "Message 2", and so on, every second until clearInterval(intervalId) is called.
